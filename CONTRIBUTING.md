4. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`.

## Adding a New Element Type

Ink Playground uses a plugin-based element system. See `docs/New element HOWTO.md` for a step-by-step guide on creating new interactive elements (games, visualizations, tools, etc.).

## Project Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `src/canvas/` | Core canvas rendering and viewport management |
| `src/elements/` | Element plugins (renderers, creators, interactions) |
| `src/input/` | Pointer event handling and stroke building |
| `src/recognition/` | Handwriting recognition API client |
| `src/eraser/` | Eraser tool and scribble detection |
| `src/state/` | Undo/redo state management |
| `src/types/` | TypeScript interfaces for the data model |

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting
- Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR
